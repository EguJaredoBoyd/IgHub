## Projects requgitirements

Make a shopping list that allows you to dynamically add items to the list using the `<form>` input and `<button>`.

When you add an item to the input and press the button:

- The item should appear in the list.
- Each item should be given a button that can be pressed to delete that item off the list.
- The input should be emptied and focused, ready for you to enter another item.
